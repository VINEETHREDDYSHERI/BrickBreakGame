# BrickBreakGame

A simple game where user control the paddle using either by Arrow Keys / Mouse based on user preference in settings. During the game in each level, Bricks and some undestroyable objects appear at top of the screen. The goal is to destroy all these bricks with the help of a ball. The paddle (i.e player) will need to ensure that the ball doesn't fall down. The Powerups, Sound, and Particle effects will make it more interesting.
